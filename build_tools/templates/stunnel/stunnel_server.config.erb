; An example Stunnel 4 configuration file.

; The cert file must contain first the private key and then the certificate.
; e.g. create a self-signed certificate on Ubuntu as follows:
;
; apt-get install ssl-cert
; make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite
; cd /etc/ssl
; cat private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem > snakeoil.pem
;
cert = <%= certificates_path %>/sslchain.crt
key = <%= certificates_path %>/star_yacketyapp_com.key
 
; Proxy configuration. Decrypt all HTTPS traffic on port 443 and pass it as
; HTTP traffic to port 80. 
;
; This will also pass on websocket traffic, but note that Socket.IO will have
; to be configured with "match origin protocol" = true to stop issues with 
; non-secure websocket protocol ws: versus secure websocket protocol wss:.
; See: https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/wiki/Configuring-Socket.IO
