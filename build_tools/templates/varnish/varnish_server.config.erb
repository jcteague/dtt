# An example Varnish configuration.
#
# This is not suitable for production use - or at least not without some
# thought about everything else you'd want Varnish to do. Don't just plug
# in a Varnish configuration found online without looking through it 
# carefully and understanding what you are trying to achieve.
#
# Important note: this configuration disables all Varnish caching! It
# only illustrates how to use Varnish to proxy websocket and non-websocket
# traffic arriving at a single port.
#
# For more comprehensive Varnish configurations that handle additional
# functionality unrelated to Node.js and websockets, but which is
# nonetheless absolutely vital for any serious use of Varnish in a 
# production environment, you might look at:
